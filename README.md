## 🏗️ Design Patterns Implementation

### 1. State Pattern

**Implementation**: ATM operational states and card reader states

```
CardReaderState (Abstract)
├── MagStripCardReaderEjected
├── MagStripCardReaderInserted
└── MagStripCardReaderReading

ATMState (Planned)
├── IdleState
├── CardInsertedState
├── PinEnteredState
├── TransactionState
└── MaintenanceState
```

**Purpose**: Manages different operational states of the ATM and its components, ensuring proper state transitions and behavior.

### 2. Strategy Pattern

**Implementation**: Cash dispensing strategies and card reading strategies

```
CashDispensingStrategy
├── MinimumNotesStrategy
├── PreferredDenominationStrategy
└── BalancedDispensingStrategy

CardReadingStrategy
├── MagStripReaderStrategy
├── ChipReaderStrategy
└── ContactlessReaderStrategy
```

**Purpose**: Allows different algorithms for cash dispensing and card reading based on requirements.

### 3. Factory Pattern

**Implementation**: Card reader factory and transaction factory

```
CardReaderFactory
├── createMagStripReader()
├── createChipReader()
└── createContactlessReader()
```

**Purpose**: Creates appropriate card reader instances based on card type detection.

### 4. Observer Pattern

**Implementation**: ATM component monitoring and event handling

```
ATMObserver
├── CashLevelObserver
├── SecurityObserver
└── MaintenanceObserver
```

**Purpose**: Monitors ATM components and triggers appropriate actions for maintenance, security, or operational events.

### 5. Command Pattern

**Implementation**: Transaction processing and user operations

```
Command (Interface)
├── WithdrawCommand
├── BalanceInquiryCommand
├── PinChangeCommand
└── StatementCommand
```

**Purpose**: Encapsulates user operations as command objects for easier execution, queuing, and rollback.

### 6. Template Method Pattern

**Implementation**: Transaction processing workflow

```
TransactionTemplate
├── validateCard()
├── authenticateUser()
├── processTransaction()
└── completeTransaction()
```

**Purpose**: Defines the skeleton of transaction processing while allowing subclasses to customize specific steps.

### 7. Singleton Pattern

**Implementation**: ATM configuration and bank connection manager

```
ATMConfiguration (Singleton)
BankConnectionManager (Singleton)
```

**Purpose**: Ensures single instances for system-wide configuration and bank connectivity management.

## 📊 System Architecture

### Component Interaction Flow

```
User → CardReader → ATM → AuthenticationService → BankService
                ↓
         TransactionProcessor → CashDispenser → ReceiptPrinter
```

### Key Design Principles

- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one specific purpose
- **Open/Closed**: System is open for extension, closed for modification
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
- **Interface Segregation**: Clients depend only on interfaces they use

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- End-to-end encryption for all transactions
- Secure PIN handling and storage
- Anti-tampering mechanisms
- Audit logging for all operations
- Network security protocols

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
